# DC4 mock dataset: exploratory CDS plots

Week 1 of the DC4 mock dataset (13,829,698 events, SAA cut applied) binned in
measured energy, Compton scattering angle phi and the scattered-photon direction
psichi, in three coordinate frames.

    # data: COSI-SMEX/DC4/Data/Mock_Dataset/dc4_mock_dataset_week_1_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz

Needs numpy, astropy, healpy, matplotlib (it does not use cosipy itself).

## Binning
- Energy: 10 log bins, 100 keV - 10 MeV. phi: 5 deg bins (36). psichi: HEALPix nside=32 (12288 pix).
- Frames (the psichi direction is the direction of the scattered gamma ray):
  - **Galactic**: `Chi galactic`, `Psi galactic` columns as (l, b).
  - **Spacecraft**: `Chi local` = longitude, `90 deg - Psi local` = latitude (z = boresight = lat +90).
  - **Earth horizon**: not in the event file, so computed per event. Zenith is the orientation
    file's `EarthZenith`, interpolated to the event time. North is the celestial pole (Earth's spin
    axis) projected onto the horizon plane. Azimuth runs from North towards East, altitude is the elevation above the horizon.
- Checked: local psichi rotated with the per-event x/z pointings (y = z cross x) matches the Galactic columns to < 0.06 deg.

## Figures (`figures/`)
- `overview_psichi.png`: psichi map summed over E and phi, with the slice disks of plot 2 marked.
- `psichi_maps_<frame>.png`: **plot 1**, psichi maps for energy slices (rows) x phi slices (columns), smoothed.
- `energy_vs_phi_<frame>.png`: **plot 2**, energy vs phi for psichi disks (r = 15 deg) around chosen directions.

Longitude increases to the left for Galactic and spacecraft (sky view) and to the right for the Earth frame (azimuth).
Slice choices (`E_SLICES`, `PHI_SLICES`, `SLICE_DIRS`, `DISK_RADIUS`) are at the top of `plot_dc4.py`.

## With a minimum first-to-second-hit distance cut
`figures_dist1cm/` has the same plots after requiring the event `Distance` column >= 1 cm
(`python bin_dc4.py ... week1_hist_d1cm.npz 32 1.0`). This keeps 57% of the week-1 events
(27% in the 100-158 keV bin, about 75% above 1 MeV).
